## What is a data management plan?

A research data management plan (DMP)

:::{.fragment style="margin:10% 0"}
is a ***living document***
:::

:::{.fragment}
can be ***updated*** at any point, as required
:::


## What is a data management plan?
A DMP will outline all the stages of a project's data lifecycle ***before*** data collection begins

- how the data will be collected, 
- stored,
- protected,
- shared,
- licensing rights to the data

## The research data lifecycle

![](images/rdm_images/rdm_lifecycle_royce.png){style="display:block;height:50%;width:50%;margin:0 auto;"}

## Why write a data management plan?
#### Organisation reasons
1. It is required
   1. By your funders
   2. By your school/faculty/department
2. Will help with project reporting to funders

## Why write a data management plan?{.smaller}
#### Personal reasons

1. Helps:
   1. Formalise a process
   2. Assess what is needed
   3. Identify areas that require attention
   4. Enforce consistency in data management
      - Being consistent with your data management will lead to fast retrieval 
2. Adapt a pre-existing DMP for a similar project
3. Refer to the DMP when writing your thesis
4. Guide the project management of your project â‡› timely thesis completion


## When to write a Research DMP?

![](images/rdm_images/when_to_write_update_rdmp-1.svg){.lightbox style="width:60%;margin-left:20%;"}
<!-- <img src="_include/when_to_write_update_rdmp-1.svg" style="margin-left: 20%; z-index:-3; width:70% !important;" id="when-rmdp"> -->

## Plan{.smaller}

### Gather your resources

- Guidance and policy documents including:
  1. Funder guidance
  2. Institutional guidance
  3. Private funder guidance (e.g. industrial sponsor)
- Decide on your DMP workflow
  - When to update
  - One vs. several DMPs
- Seek reviewers for your DMP

## Plan{.smaller}

### Consider your project

- Pre-existing data
- Research group data management methods
  1. Does the group use a particular storage system?
  2. How does my group share files internally and externally?
  3. How does my group collaborate?
  4. How does my group manage physical data storage, i.e. samples
- Institutional data management resources
- Is the data sensitive to a defence or commercial project?

## Collect

- What type of data?
  - Physical (Don't forget samples are data too!)
    - What types of samples?
  - Digital
    - What file formats?

## Collect

- How?
  - Physical
    - Received from partner?
    - Created in lab?
  - Digital
    - What pieces of data acquisition equipment?
    - How data will be generated from simulations?

## Collect

- Where will the data be acquired from?
  - Novel?
  - Publicly available?
  - Data from group?
  - Data from partners?

## Collect{.smaller}

- What Software do I need?
  - Do I need specialised software to acquire and analyse the data?
  - What type of file formats does the software I need export to?
  - Can I convert acquired data to open file formats?
  - How will I acquire this software? 
    - Free and Open Source? Paid license?
- What support will I need from institutional resources (people)?
- What software will I be using to track samples?
  - Sample tracking software?
- What software will I be using to track experiments?
  - Electronic laboratory notebooks?

## Process{.smaller}
- Does data need to be transferred between locations?
- How will data be organised?
  - Sensible directory naming conventions
  - Sensible file naming conventions
- Does data come in proprietary file formats?
  - Does it need to be converted to an open file format?
  - Will it be easily accessible by 'analysis programmes'?
- Will data need to be cleaned before analysis?

:::{.fragment}
<span style="font-size:3rem;">***How will the processing step be documented?***</span>
:::

## Analyse

<div style="margin: 20% 0;">

<span style="font-size:4rem;">***Well documented == reproducible***</span>

</div>
## Preserve
- How will the data be stored temporarily, short-term, long-term?
- How long will the data be retained for after the end of the project?
- Will the data be archived?
- Are there any data destruction procedures that need to be followed?
- Public v Institutional (or Subscription) & Open v Subscription-based Repositories

## Share

Two aspects to sharing research and data:

1. Internal to the project
   - Perhaps external to your institution
2. Publishing  


## Share{.smaller}

Consider:

- Who owns the intellectual property rights to the data?
- Partner policy
- Funder policy

Will determine:

- Who will has rights to reuse it?
- If the data will remain with the research group
- How the data can be shared?
- Where the data can be shared?

## Share

Repositories:

- Which repository will make my data more visible? (**F**indable to the community)
- Is there a specific repository to desposit to in accordance with my funder policy?
- Could my data be made more **A**ccessible **I**nteroperable **R**eusable?
- How do I want to license my data/code?

## Share

Open access:

<ol>
<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Diamond</li>
<li class="fragment">Gold</li>
<li class="fragment">Green</li>
</ol>

<!-- :::{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
1. Diamond
:::
1. Gold
2. Green -->

Financial aspect:

- What will I do if I can't publish Gold Open Access?

## Tips

:::{.fragment}
Weave RDM practices into your everyday workflow
:::

:::{.fragment .faded-smaller}
Not just an afterthought or check-marking activity
:::

:::{.fragment .faded-smaller}
Even as a one-person lab
:::

:::{.fragment .faded-smaller}
It is part of your work and responsibilities
:::

:::{.fragment}
Seniors need to encourage, support and promote RDM
:::

:::{.fragment}
Ask if your research group has a nominated data management champion
:::

## Remember

:::{.fragment style="margin:10% 0"}
It is a ***living document***
:::

:::{.fragment}
can ***change*** to reflect changes in the direction of your project
